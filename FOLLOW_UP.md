Hi Tim,

It was great catching up and learning more about Imagine Learning’s engineering culture. I really appreciate your time and insights. I just submitted my application for Principal Software Engineer (Ruby on Rails) and wanted to follow up as we discussed. If you’re able to mention my application to the hiring manager, I’d greatly appreciate it. I’ve attached my resume and cover letter here for reference.

Thanks again for your help, and I look forward to staying in touch!

Ian
