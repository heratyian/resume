RE: Principal Software Engineer - Ruby on Rails

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Principal Software Engineer (Ruby on Rails) position at Imagine
Learning. As a technologist, founder, and educator with a passion for leveraging technology to
drive meaningful impact, I am eager to contribute my expertise in software engineering and
cloud architecture to your mission-driven team.

Before transitioning into software development, I taught English as a Second Language to
middle school students in China. This experience deepened my appreciation for K-12
education and reinforced my commitment to building tools that enhance learning outcomes.

In my current role as a Software Development Educator at the Discovery Partners Institute, I
have designed and led full-stack software curricula, focusing on Ruby on Rails, and
collaborating with industry leaders such as John Deere and Blue Cross Blue Shield to bridge
the gap between education and workforce needs. Prior to this, I co-founded Big Green
Company, where I spearheaded the development of receipt-ai.com (an AI-powered expense
tracking platform) demonstrating my ability to build and scale innovative solutions. My tenure
at Nerdery further refined my technical acumen, where I delivered high-impact software
solutions and consistently exceeded client expectations.

While my primary expertise is in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, I am also a certified Azure
Developer with multi-cloud experience. Beyond technical skills, I mentor engineers to foster
growth and collaboration within teams, ensuring a strong culture of continuous learning and
innovation.

I am eager to bring my technical leadership and problem-solving mindset to Imagine Learning
and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your goals. Thank you
for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your mission.

Best regards,
